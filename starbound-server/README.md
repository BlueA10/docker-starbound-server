# starbound-server
My attempt at making a Starbound dedicated server Docker image, for my own server uses and for the learning experience and fun of it.

Currently in the phase where I'm learning a lot of new things at once and changing things frequently as I carve out a better idea of what I want with this and how I'm going to do it.

Pull and run at your own peril.
```
docker run -ti -p 21025:21025 bluea10/starbound-server:latest
```
You can detach after succesfully logging in to SteamCMD.
